# About Me

Hello! I'm Colin, a 17 year old IT student from Switzerland.   
I'm currently making an apprenticeship as a "Betriebsinformatiker EFZ" at Georg Fischer AG in Schaffhausen.   
In my free time I like to program what's on my mind, or talk with friends on Discord.

## My Portfolio
On my portfolio you can find projects that I've worked on/am I working on.  
There are also some posts about me and things I like to do.
