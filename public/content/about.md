# About Me

Hello! I'm Colin, a 17 year old IT student from Switzerland.   
I'm currently making an apprenticeship as a "Betriebsinformatiker EFZ" at Georg Fischer AG in Schaffhausen.   
There I'm working at the local IT department, where I'm responsible for the local infrastructure and the support of the employees.   
In my free time I like to program what's on my mind, that's involves frontend, backend and also some hardware related stuff.     
When I'm not programming I like to talk with friends on Discord or go out riding bike in the forest.
